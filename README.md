# Read Me

In this repository I am collecting any and all files, that document my efforts in learning different methods used in the analysis and visualization of data.

This repository was created at the beginning of my master's programme in psychology at the University of Constance (winter of 2022). It will include methods, that were taught to me (by myself or others) during the course of said master's programme.

This repository was made public in order to facilitate access by interested parties at the University of Constance and beyond.
