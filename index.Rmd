# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book shall document my efforts in learning different methods used in the analysis of psychological data.

Since this book was created at the beginning of my master's programme in psychology at the University of Constance (winter of 2022), this repository will only include methods, that were taught to me (by myself or others) during the course of said master's programme.
